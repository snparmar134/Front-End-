Q1. What is MongoDB.
    mongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that uses a data-oriented database model. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not store data in tables with rows and columns; stores dynamic, JSON-like data with dynamic schemas. This means that each record in the MongoDB database can have its own structure that can be updated over time.


Q2. What is difference between mongo DB and SQL
   - SQL databases follow a tabular structure while MongoDB follows a document-oriented data model
   - In SQL databases, a predefined schema is required, specifying the structure of each table, including the data types of each column, while MongoDB is schema-less or schema-flexible. Each document can have its own structure, and new fields can be added to documents without affecting other documents in the collection.
   - SQL databases use the SQL query language, which is standardized and well-established, while MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language for querying documents.
   - SQL databases typically scale vertically, while MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally.
   - SQL databases are often used for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and strong consistency guarantees, such as banking systems, while MongoDB is well-suited for applications with rapidly evolving requirements, unstructured or semi-structured data, and horizontal scalability requirements, such as content management systems.
