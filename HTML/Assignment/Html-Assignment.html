                browser can mix them with tags that's
                why character entities are used in HTML to display reserved characters.

                <li>
                    To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS

                        HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language which is the most widely used language over the internet.
                        <br><br>
                        HTML is used to create web pages and link them from one to another

                    <strong>Advantages of HTML</strong>

                        <li>
                            Easier to code: HTML5 has a more relaxed syntax compared to XHTML, which makes it easier to
                            code
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Backward compatibility: HTML5 is designed to be backward compatible with older versions of
                            HTML, which means that it can be used with older web browsers
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Multimedia support: HTML5 includes support for multimedia elements such as video and audio,
                            which makes it easier to create web pages that include multimedia content
                        </li>

                            Non-standardization: HTML5 is not a standardized markup language, which means that different
                            web browsers may interpret it differently

                        <li>
                            Security issues: HTML5 includes new features such as geolocation and offline storage, which
                            can create security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly

                            HTML5 documents properly, which can create compatibility issues for developers

                            Strict syntax: XHTML has a stricter syntax compared to HTML5, which means that it is more

                        <li>
                            Standardization: XHTML follows the syntax rules of XML, which is a standardized markup
                            language. This makes it easier to create interoperable web pages that work well with
                            different web browsers and devices

                            choice for developers who want to create web pages that can be easily processed by other
                            software tools
